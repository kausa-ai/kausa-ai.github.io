The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: [https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/](https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/)\n\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree to the following:\n\n* users can visit our site anonymously;\n* our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;\n* users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;\n* users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at [support@kausa.ai](mailto:support@kausa.ai).\n\nOur Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:\n\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.
