</li>
<li>
<p>The Customer may not settle any claim that would bind Kausa to any obligation or require any admission of fault by Kausa, without Kausa&#x27;s prior written consent.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Where Kausa engages another Subcontractor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of Customer, the same data protection obligations as set out in this data processing agreement shall be imposed on the Subcontractor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient safeguards to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. The parties clarify that in order to impose the same data protection obligations it is sufficient if the level of protection under the subcontract corresponds to the level of protection under this Data Processing Agreement.</p>

 Scope of Applicability\n    ======================\n    \n    1.  These SaaS Terms set forth the terms and conditions under which The Why Company GmbH, Max-Urich-Straße 3, 13355 Berlin, Germany (\"**Kausa**\") will provide the entity executing the agreement with Kausa (the \"**Customer**\") with access to certain applications as ordered by the Customer (\"**Kausa Solution**\") using the order form that is made available by Kausa on its website (the \"**Website Order Form**\").\n        \n    2.  The provisions of the Website Order Form, as accepted by the Customer, and these SaaS Terms form the agreement governing the use of the Kausa Solution (the \"**SaaS Agreement**\"). In case of conflicts, the provisions of the Website Order Form shall prevail over the provisions of these SaaS Terms.\n        \n2.  License Grant and Right of Use\n    ==============================\n    \n    1.  Kausa makes available the Kausa Solution to the Customer under a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model limited to the term of this SaaS Agreement as defined in the Website Order Form (the \"**Subscription Term**\").\n        \n    2.  Subject to all limitations and restrictions contained in this SaaS Agreement, Kausa grants the Customer a non-exclusive, and non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access the Kausa Solution as hosted by Kausa during the Subscription Term and to use it solely to perform those functions described in the Website Order Form for its internal business purposes (the \"**SaaS License**\").\n        \n    3.

The Customer will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of user login information and credentials for accessing Kausa Solution and will notify Kausa promptly of any loss, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of such login information and/or credentials of which Customer becomes aware. Kausa will not be liable for any damage or loss that may result from Customer's breach of the foregoing obligations.\n        \n    4.  Unless expressly provided otherwise in the Website Order Form, \"**Authorized Users**\" will only consist of: (i) employees of the Customer, and (ii) subject to Section 8 (Confidentiality), third party contractors of the Customer who do not compete with Kausa and who may use the Kausa Solution only at the Customer's place of business or in the presence of Customer personnel.

The Customer will be liable for any violation of obligations by its Authorized Users or by other third parties who violate obligations within the Customer's control.\n        \n    7.

In case of gross negligence, Kausa shall be liable according to the statutory provisions of applicable law.\n        \n    3.  In case of ordinary negligence, Kausa shall – provided that the standard of liability is not limited according to statutory provisions of applicable law (such as any limitation to the duty of care observed in own affairs) – only be liable for breach of material contractual obligations (material contractual obligations are obligations the breach of which endangers the purpose of the agreement and the fulfilment of which the Customer generally relies and may reasonably rely on); in this case Kausa's liability shall be limited to the typical damages that were reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, indirect and consequential damages resulting from defects of the delivered goods and/or work are only eligible for compensation if such damages are typical and reasonably foreseeable and when the goods and/or work are used in conformity with its intended purpose.\n        \n    4.  The aforementioned limitations do not apply to\n        \n        1.  damages resulting from injury to life, body or health;\n            \n        2.  liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act;\n            \n        3.  the assumption of a guarantee for the condition of goods and/or work or fraudulent concealment of defects by Kausa.\n            \n    5.  The aforementioned limitations of liability shall, subject to the provisions of Section 10.4, apply to (i) any liability claims for whatever legal reason but in particular due to impossibility, default, defective or incorrect delivery, breach of contract, breach of obligations in contractual negotiations and tort, as far as such claims are subject to fault, and (ii) any breach of duty by vicarious agents or any other person for whose conduct Kausa can be held liable according to the statutory provisions of applicable law.\n        \n11. Customer Indemnity\n    ==================\n    \n    1.  Customer will defend Kausa from any third party claim (\"**Claim**\"), and will indemnify and hold harmless Kausa from and against any damages and costs awarded against Kausa, or agreed in settlement by Customer (including attorneys' fees) resulting from such Claim, to the extent caused by:\n        \n        1.  modifications of the Kausa Solution by Customer, its affiliates, users, or third party contractors,\n            \n        2.  Customer's or its affiliate's unauthorized supply, disclosure, or processing of Customer Data, including personal data therein, and\n            \n        3.  Customer's or its affiliate's violation of laws applicable to Customer's or its affiliate's business.\n            \n    2.  Customer will have no liability or obligation with respect to any Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by Kausa's breach of this SaaS Agreement or violation of applicable law.\n        \n    3.  In the event of a potential indemnity obligation under this Section, Kausa will: (i) promptly notify the Customer in writing of the claim, (ii) allow the Customer the right to control the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim at the Customer's sole cost and expense, and (iii) upon request of the Customer, provide all necessary cooperation at the Customer's expense.\n        \n    4.  Failure by Kausa to notify the Customer of a claim under this Section will not relieve the Customer of its obligations under this Section, however, the Customer will not be liable for any litigation expenses that Kausa incurred prior to the time when notice is given or for any damages and/or costs resulting from any material prejudice caused by the delay or failure to provide notice to the Customer in accordance with this Section.\n        \n    5.  The Customer may not settle any claim that would bind Kausa to any obligation or require any admission of fault by Kausa, without Kausa's prior written consent.\n        \n12. Term and Termination\n    ====================\n    \n    1.  The Subscription Term shall be defined in the Website Order Form.\n        \n    2.  If agreed on the Website Order Form, the Subscription Term may commence with a pilot period as specified on the Website Order Form.\n        \n    3.  If the Website Order Form does not contain any specific provisions on the Subscription Term, the Subscription Term shall commence upon execution of the Purchaser Order and shall run for an initial term of one (1) year. Thereafter, it shall extend automatically by consecutive one (1) year renewal terms, unless terminated by either Party with three (3) months' written notice to the end of the initial term or any renewal term.\n        \n    4.  Upon termination of this SaaS Agreement, the Customer shall no longer access the Kausa Solution and the Customer shall not circumvent any security mechanisms contained therein.\n        \n    5.  Termination of this SaaS Agreement will not limit either Party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor will such termination relieve the Customer's obligation to pay all Service Fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by the Customer under this SaaS Agreement.\n        \n    6.  Within thirty (30) days following the termination of this SaaS Agreement for any reason and the submission of a request to transfer data (\"Data Transfer Request\"), whatever is later, Kausa will provide the Customer with an extract of all Customer Data stored on the Software at the moment of termination, in machine-readable format. A Data Transfer Request must be submitted within seven (7) days of termination. Absent a Data Transfer Request, Kausa will delete the Customer Data from its Software.\n        \n    7.
